# C_Study_Workspace

A Visual Studio (MSVC) workspace for my C programming coursework: lectures, exercises, and small demos.

## Toolchain
- Windows 11
- Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC)
- C (C11-style learning; MSVC-compatible)
- Input via `scanf_s` (validated)

## Layout
- Each folder is an independent VS project (`.vcxproj`) with its own `main.c`
- Projects cover core fundamentals (control flow, functions, input validation, small interactive apps)

## Build & Run
1. Open `C_Study_Workspace.sln`
2. Select a project → **Set as Startup Project**
3. Run: `Ctrl + F5` (no debug) or `F5` (debug)

## Notes
This repo is iterative and may change as I refine examples and structure.
